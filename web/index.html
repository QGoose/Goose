      <h2>Simple</h2>
      <img src="./simple.png" alt="">
      <p>
        Quantum Computing might sound a little bit scarry.
        Goose is designed with simplicity in mind making it accessible
        to a wide audience ranging from students to advanced researchers.

      <h2>Modular</h2>
      <img src="./modular.png" alt="">
      <p>
        The design of the library is highly modular thanks to the use of
        OCaml functors. Combined with the strong typing of OCaml, this allows to safely customize
        the libraries to fit your needs.

      <h2>Extensible</h2>

      <p>
        The functor-oriented style of Goose and its strongly-typed API constitutes
        an ideal foundation for further extensions. From compilers to static-analyzers,
        Goose gives you the basic building blocks you need to prototype new tools for quantum programming
        languages.

      <h1>Circuit IR</h1>
      <p>
        Goose is an OCaml library to mode, simulate, and compile quantum programs.
        In its core, it features a simple intermediate representation (IR) for quantum circuits.
        This IR can be targeted by compilers or used as an input for Goose's builtin simulator and compiler.
      </p>
      <h2>Open QASM</h2>
      <p>
        OpenQASM is an open-source assembly-like programming language to design quantum circuits.
        It is the <i>defacto</i> standard for interoperability of quantum computing tools.
        Goose supports <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03429v2">Open QASM 2.0</a> as an input language and features
        a compiler from
        OpenQASM to IR.
      </p>
      <h2>Simulation</h2>
      <p>
        You don't have access to a Quantum Computer? Don't worry! Goose features an easy to use quantum simulator.
        Goose's simulator takes IR circuits as an input and returns the result of the simulation as an array of complex
        numbers.
      </p>
      <h2>Compilation to C</h2>
      <p>
        Large circuits with a lot of qbits can take long to simulate. When performance is an issue, Goose
        can
        compile circuits to efficient C code. The C translation is performed by symbolic simulation of the circuit.
