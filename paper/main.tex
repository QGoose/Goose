\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Quantum computing is an emerging model of computation that exploits non-classical effects like superposition and entanglement to achieve algorithmic speedups. A radical break from classical computation, the model presents new challenges for programming languages research. In this presentation, we showcase Goose: an OCaml library to model, simulate and compile low-level quantum programs. Goose is designed to support research into quantum programming languages through an emphasis on ease of use and extensibility. The library is compatible with the OpenQASM standard, and targets a variety of backends with a minimalistic circuit-based IR.

\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item Hardware is scarce, Hardware doesn't work well
\item Libraries/frameworks are all in weakly-typed Python (cf. Qiskit, Cirq)
\item we should push the PL angle more
\item Connecting IRs (never mind high-level languages) to the stuff you see in books: how? May not be obvious.
\item challenges: accessibility, tooling needed, hardware errors and correctness matters
\end{itemize}

% As an alternative, simulation on classical hardware provides researchers the opportunity to explore novel quantum algorithms without access to a real quantum system.
Quantum computing is an emerging model of computation that exploits non-classical physical effects like superposition and entanglement to achieve algorithmic speedups. Despite these performance promises and recent advances in the hardware implementation of quantum computers, widespread access remains limited. Furthermore, the current Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (\nisq) era systems are error-prone and can only maintain their coherence for a limited time. In addition, they typically do not have enough qubits to run meaningful algorithms and there may be further restrictions in terms of allowed gates and qubit connectivity. 

As an alternative to physical quantum computers, simulation on classical computers allows researchers to study quantum algorithms without such restrictions and with predictable errors. Additionally, simulators enable researchers to artificially emulate errors to predict the behaviour of their algorithms on \nisq era quantum computers.

For this reason, programming language researchers need accessible tools for compilation and classical simulation of quantum programs.

In this presentation, we showcase Goose: an extensible library to model, simulate and compile quantum programs.

that lays the foundation for further quantum programming languages research in the OCaml ecosystem. Goose is a low-level compilation framework that … [multiple input representations] … [multiple backends]
